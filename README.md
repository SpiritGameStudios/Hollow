## üìñ About
Have you ever seen that one birch forest concept and thought, "Wow, I wish that was actually in the game"? Well then this mod is for you.

Hollow adds in as many missing features as it can, fulfilling Mojang's hollow promises.

## ‚ùì FAQ
* Forge? <br/>
No. Do not ask me for forge or you will be blocked instantly.
* Do you plan to add `X`? <br/>
If it's in one of the concept art images, probably. Some features take longer than others.
If you want to suggest something, join the [discord](https://discord.gg/TTmx7d2axf).
* Can you port/backport to `X` version? <br/>
Updating is a maybe. Seeing as I'm making this for fun, it comes down to whatever version I'm playing on at the time. For backports, probably not. I might do `1.19.2` as I play that a lot but other than that, no.
