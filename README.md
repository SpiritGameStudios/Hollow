## üìñ About
*DISCLAIMER: Do not use the existence of this mod as an excuse to harass Mojang. The name is a joke, Mojang promised nothing.*

Have you ever seen that one birch forest concept and thought, "Wow, I wish that was actually in the game"? Well then this mod is for you.

Hollow adds in as many missing features as it can, fulfilling Mojang's "hollow" promises.

## ‚ùì FAQ
* Forge? <br/>
  No. Do not ask us for forge or neoforge support. It isn't happening.

* Can I use this mod in a Mod Pack? <br/>
  Yes! Go ahead! Just make sure we are credited somewhere and don't reupload our .jar file. If you make a pack with one of our mods, we would love to know! Join our discord and tell us!

* Do you plan to add `X`? <br/>
  If it's in one of the concept art images, probably. Some features take longer than others. If you want to suggest something, join the [discord](https://discord.gg/TTmx7d2axf).

* Can you port/backport to `X` version? <br/>
  Updates to new versions will probably happen at some point. Porting is hard and takes time so don't expect it instantly.
  Backports won't happen. Multiversion modding is hard, annoying, and not worth the effort.
